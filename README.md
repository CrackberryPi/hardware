# CrackberryPi hardware

## The plan

The idea is to develop a a complete handheld system based on the Raspberry Pi. For this purpose we plan to create a PCB that will provide a small touch screen, a tiny keyboard and some other features. Together with a custom enclosure and a Lithium Ion battery this would form a complete handheld system.
